# Ideas
* Functions for common tasks with autonomous.
* Use Jumpers for switching autonomous.
  * Have one pin determine autonomous version. (Far tile or close tile relative to flags)
  * Have the other pin determine team color. (In means Red, out means Blue)
  * Allows us to have 4 different autonomous plans 'saved'.
